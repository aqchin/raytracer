<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>
In this project, we implement Photon Mapping and Depth of Field.
The scene we selected is the infamous Cornell Box with three spheres with
each of the following properties: diffuse, reflection, and refraction.
We configure the Depth of Field to focus on the diffuse ball in the center
while two others are placed in front of and behind it.

<h2>Progress</h2>
<P>
In our approach to Photon Mapping, we start by accumulating the Photon Map.
For each light in the scene, we continuously shoot out photons into the scene
until a specified number of them are stored in the scene. This process can
take a fairly significant amount of time, especially if the light source is
not enclosed in an environment. We take the Russian Roulette approach to 
handle how photons are stored or reflected in the environment. By using this,
instead of scaling the photon per reflection, we keep the reserve the same
amount of power until the map is filled. In order to attain indirect
lighting, we multiply the power of the photon by the color of the surface
when it reflects. After filling the photon map, we scale all the photons down
by the total number of photons emitted.

The next step is applying the photons to the scene. For each pixel, we estimate
the color based on the surrounding photons.

After working on Photon Mapping, we decided to add Depth of Field to our
scene. This was a fairly straightforward modification to our camera. What we
do is define an aperture value in addition to a focus length which
essentially defines the blur intensity and viewing plane, respectively.
With each pixel, we sample some amount of random rays shot through the
aperture and we average that value sort of like with path tracing. Below is
the result of Depth of Field. Looking closely, the most obvious blurred area is the end of the plane, although some areas of the teapot show some
degree of blur.

Next, we move to the creative aspect of the assignment which is creating a
scene. In order to demonstrate the best aspects of the techniques we have
implemented, we decided to use the Cornell Box. Below is an image of the
scene in its work stages. This is done with no photon mapping, and contains
one reflecting and one refracting ball.

With careful planning and coordination, we eventually get an image like
below. This one does use photon mapping. This eventually leads up to our final image displayed at the very bottom.
